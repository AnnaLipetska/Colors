The app should 
1. be able to give you the pallet of colors which are the most frequent in an image
2. be integrated with https://api.clarifai.com/api-doc/ in order to get some additional info
3. from an image and a pallet of colors given by a user create a simplified version of the image (possible ways to use - embroidery and beadwork)
4. size of the "beads" should be adjustable
5. in a db mb we could store color and size of most popular producers' beads (we could choose one the most popular at first)
